# Air Cargo Traffic Analysis

## Data Source
Chosen Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitvkulkarni/air-traffic-cargo-statistics
The data is a cargo air traffic data from Kaggle which is owned by the author. The original date source is https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-traffic-cargo-statistics which is an US government source which means that we can consider this data trustworthy.

## Data sourcing and collection method
Because the original data comes from a government source it is open and administrative data.
The primary sources of this dataset are likely aviation authorities, airlines, and other entities involved in air cargo operations. These sources would provide raw data on metrics such as airline performance, geographic distribution, activity types, aircraft utilization, and cargo metrics.
Data collection methods could include direct reporting from airlines, air cargo carriers, and airport authorities. Automated systems within airports and cargo terminals may also capture data on cargo movements, aircraft utilization, and other relevant metrics.

## Data Limitations
•	Data Accuracy: 
The accuracy of the dataset depends on the quality of the data provided by various sources. Errors or inconsistencies in reporting could affect the reliability of the analysis.
•	Coverage: 
The dataset may not capture all air cargo operations globally, as it relies on voluntary reporting from airlines and other entities. Some regions or smaller carriers may be underrepresented.
•	Temporal Scope: 
The dataset may have limitations in terms of its temporal scope. Historical data may be available for analysis, but it's essential to consider the relevance of older data in understanding current trends and patterns.

## Ethical considerations
•	Privacy: 
While the dataset doesn't contain explicit personal information, it may still include sensitive business data related to airlines, cargo types, and operations. Ensuring that this information is anonymized and aggregated appropriately is crucial to protect the privacy of the entities involved.

•	Data Usage: 
Users of the dataset must handle the data ethically and responsibly, ensuring that it's not used for malicious purposes or to harm the interests of airlines, cargo carriers, or other stakeholders.

•	Transparency: 
It's essential to be transparent about the source of the data, any limitations or biases present, and the methodologies used for data collection and processing. This transparency fosters trust among users and helps mitigate potential ethical concerns.

•	Fair Representation: 
The dataset should strive to represent the diversity of air cargo operations accurately, avoiding biases that could disproportionately impact certain regions, airlines, or types of cargo. Fair representation ensures that the analysis reflects the realities of the industry. 

## Relevance
•	Industry Insights: 
The dataset provides valuable insights into various aspects of air cargo operations, including airline performance, cargo types, and geographic distribution. Stakeholders in the air cargo industry can use this information to optimize operations, identify trends, and make strategic decisions.

•	Business Strategy: 
Airlines, cargo carriers, logistics companies, and other industry players can use the dataset to benchmark their performance against competitors, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategic initiatives to enhance efficiency and profitability.

•	Predictive Analytics: 
Historical data in the dataset can be used to develop predictive models for forecasting air cargo trends, demand fluctuations, and operational challenges. Such models help stakeholders anticipate future scenarios and make proactive decisions to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities.

## Define questions
#### Clarifying question:
1.	How do the cargo weights vary across different types of cargo and airlines, and which airlines handle the highest average cargo weights?
   
2.	When analyzing the activity periods, what seasonal patterns emerge in air cargo operations, and how do these patterns vary across different geographic regions?
   
53.	Where are the busiest air cargo hubs located geographically, and how does the volume of cargo differ between these hubs throughout the year?

#### Funneling Questions:
For clarifying question 1:
1.	What are the most common types of cargo transported by air, and how do their average weights compare across different airlines?
   
2.	Among the top airlines handling air cargo, which ones exhibit the highest variability in cargo weights across different types of cargo?

For clarifying question 3:
1.	Which geographic regions emerge as the primary hubs for air cargo operations, and what factors contribute to their prominence in the industry?
   
2.	Among the identified air cargo hubs, how does the volume of cargo fluctuate throughout the year, and are there any noticeable seasonal trends or peak periods?

## Privacy and Ethics
•	How is personally identifiable information (PII) handled within the dataset, particularly concerning individuals or businesses involved in air cargo operations?

•	How are potential biases in the dataset addressed to ensure fair representation and equitable analysis, particularly concerning underrepresented regions or types of cargo?

•	What ethical guidelines or principles guide the use of the dataset to ensure that it is employed responsibly and ethically, avoiding any misuse or misrepresentation that could harm stakeholders or the industry?
